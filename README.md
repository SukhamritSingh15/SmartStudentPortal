# SmartStudentPortal

SmartStudentPortal is a React + Vite application for managing student-related features (CGPA calculator, notice board, leave requests, etc.).  
This repository uses Vite for fast development and includes ESLint configuration.

## Template info (kept from the original Vite template)

This project was bootstrapped with a minimal React + Vite template that provides HMR and ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
<<<<<<< HEAD
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

### React Compiler
The React Compiler is not enabled in this template because of its impact on dev & build performance. To add it, see the React Compiler installation docs.

### ESLint / TypeScript
If you later move to a production setup, consider adding TypeScript with type-aware lint rules. See the Vite TS template for guidance.
